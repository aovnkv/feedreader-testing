# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

# Instructions

1.  Download or clone the repository to your computer and open index.html from the root folder.
2.  The tests will run automatically.
3.  Passed test should highlight green and failed - red.
4.  See the source code and comments for the tests in [feedreader.js](https://github.com/aovnkv/feedreader-testing/blob/master/jasmine/spec/feedreader.js)
